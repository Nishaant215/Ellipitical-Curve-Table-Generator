# Ellipitical-Curve-Table-Generator

This script generates a table of elliptical points for the given curve (equations) and the scalar multiplication of each point to find the order of each point.
A generator point is a point on the curve that has the highest order in comparison to other points on the curve.

Run the script: EC_Points_Table
