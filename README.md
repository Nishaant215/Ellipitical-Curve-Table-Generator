# Ellipitical-Curve-Table-Generator

This script generates a table of elliptical points for the given curve (equations) and the scalar multiplication of each point to find the order of each point.
A generator point is a point on the curve that has the highest order in comparison to other points on the curve. The table gets outputted as CSV file to view in excel.

Run the script:**EC_Points_Table.py**

A possible generator is (0,3) because it is one of the points on the curve with the highest order.
